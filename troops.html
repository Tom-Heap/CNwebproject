                A vital part to playing pendor is the kind of troops you decide to keep with you and to garrison your castles and towns. NPC lords will decide which settlement
                focus their entire factions attack on during a war based on the number of troops and their quality in a garrison, so it best to have a lot of cheaper troops 
                who have a decent quality. Pendor troops are the best kind for garrisons as they can be upgraded to a decent quality quickly. Pendor recruits cannot be found
                in villages at the start of the game as no location has the pendor culture to create them until the player has their own faction and selects that culture.
                Pendor recruits can be found in the early game by upgrading peasents or farmers into them. </p>

            The best kind of infantry troop that can be upgraded from a recruit is the fierdsvain huscarl. They have good shields to prevent them quickly dying to archers, axes
            which deal damage that penetrates armor and throwing axes which are powerful throwing weapons and are effective against mounted troops. These troops are best used in
            your own army when you want to attack in a siege</p>

                The best kind of cavalry troop that can be upgraded from a recruit is the saleron cavalry. They have heavily armored horses and decent riding skill to make up for
                their lack of speed and longswords and shields they can use if they dismount or get into close quarters. Their best quality is their skill with lances, they charge
                enemy troops and deal extra damage based their movement speed when they hit, they deal extra damage on top of that with their couched lances. Its best to travel with
                cavalry in your own party regardless of if you are using them in a siege or not due to their combat ability and the world map movement speed granted by having aswell   
                mounted troops in your party.</p>

                The best kind of archery troop that can be upgraded from a recruit is the Ravenstern ranger. They take a lot of experience to upgrade but are well worth it.
                They have long composite bows which have good armor penetration and very long range and they are very accurate. Their armor and close combat ability leaves a lot
                to be desired however, so keep them in the back lines of your army where they can do the most damage. These troops are best used in your own army when you want
                to attack in a siege. They can be used as garrison troops but are more expensive than the pendor heavy bowman.</p>

                Custom knighthood orders are knighthood orders the player can create themselves, they cost a qualis gem to create. When you make it you get to pick the name of
                their main knight troop and the lesser sergant troop. The troops for a custom knighthood order can, with investment of both time and money, become
                the best troops in the game. You pay money to your steward to equip these troops with weapons and armor you yourself have unlocked or found, potentially giving 
                them access to the best gear. It takes an amount of in game days for them to be equiped with these weapons or armor and you can only equip them with one piece at
                a time. You can also pay to have their proficiencies and attributes increased at your castle steward. Futhermore your compainions can be instructed to train them
                for a period of between one and four weeks, the longer the training period the better the effect of the training. To get recruits you
                must own either a town or a castle and have built the training ground, you'll recieve a random number of noble recruits every week based on your renown and will
                need to upgrade these recruits into knights before they can be inducted into your custom knighthood order.</p>
