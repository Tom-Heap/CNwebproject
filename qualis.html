                Qualis gems are rare items that can be exchanged for many different rewards, worth more to the player than its sell value.
                There is only one guaranteed qualis gem spawn location and the rest you'll want are all randomly generated. While you don't need any qualis gems
                to complete the game they can make the difference in the game being easier or difficult.   </p>

            The one guaranteed qualis gem in the game is located in Rane, a town in the northern part of the map and is held by the Ravenstern faction.
            Enter the town and head left, go around the corner and face right, in the pile of hay is a chest with a qualis gem in it.

                Another option if you want more qualis gems is to win the noldor tournaments and hope to get one as a prize. Though before you
                have that option you need to gain access to the noldor, a guide to which you can find in the noldor section of this website.
                Even then the chance of getting a qualis gem as a prize in the noldor tournaments is random, about a twenty percent chance, making this option less
                favorable than the next option.</p>

            <p class = "noldortext">
                However, the most reliable way to get qualis gems is through fighting, defeating and capturing the unique characters that spawn with their armies
                every now and then on the world map. Unfortunately these uniques characters always spawn with large armies of around 600 troops. If you succeed in defeating
                a unique characters army you will have a chance of capturing them based on your current prisoner management skill, capping out at a 90% chance of catching 
                the unique character at a prisoner management skill of 10. If you do capture them you will have the option of releasing them in exchange for a qualis gem.  </p>

                Now that you have a qualis gem you'll need to know where you can spend them. Finneas de Digit is a merchant who will be in the tavern of a random town
                at the start of the game and will move from town to town periodically. You can pay any traveller npc found in a tavern 50 gold to be told his current location.
                Finneas sells books but will also trade one of three potions for your qualis gem. The first is an "Elixir of Arkon" which increases your strength, agility and
                charisma by two, aswell as all your proficiencies by thirty. The second is a "potion of Janus" which will increase your intelligence by two and 
                give you two skill points. The third will randomly increase either your companions strength, agility and charisma by two, their intelligence by two or their 
                proficiencies by 40. After you've traded with him three times the effects of these potions will be halved. </p>

                Brother Randolf is another merchant npc that can be found randomly in taverns. For a qualis gem he will give you a map to the mines of Al-Aziz, the location of which
                is randomised on the world map. You cannot find the mines until you have payed the qualis gem. In the mines you can trade another qualis gem to the weapon smith for 
                a rune weapon, one of each weapon type. The hermit next to the weaponsmith will upgrade your rune weapon with either a ruby, an emerald or a sapphire which changes
                the weapons stats. He will do this for one wine, one qualis gem and a lrage pouch of diamonds. These weapons are some of the best in the game.</p>
