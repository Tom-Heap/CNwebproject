                There are seven different types of weapons in pendor. One handed weapons such as swords, axes and maces, two handed weapons which include claymores, staffs and
                large axes, polearms such as spears and lances, bows, crossbows, throwing weapons like throwing axes and javalins and firearms. Your proficiencies will determine your
                ability with the various weapons like weapon speed and accuracy with ranged weapons.</p>

                Some of the best weapons to be found in the game are the ones held by the various kings and khans who lead the main factions. To get these you must capture the king of
                a faction when his faction has less than five towns or castles. You will then have the option of taking his weapon in exchange for letting him go free. This will drop
                his relation with you by 20.

                Another good set of weapons are the rune weapons. These can be found in the hidden mines, the location of which is detailed in the qualis gems sections of this website.
                They can be upgraded to make them either faster, stronger or longer. Most are easier to get than the faction leader weapons and are only slightly worse, the rune bow when
                upgraded with rubies is the best bow in the game.</p>
