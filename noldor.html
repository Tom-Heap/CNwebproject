                Noldor are high level, high skilled troops of the noldor faction,<br> you begin as their enemies but can befriend them for various benefits. <br>
        They can be found in the north eastern part of the map.</p>

                Noldor relations need to be raised from minus thirty to zero to prevent them attacking on sight.<br>
                This can be done by aiding them in combat, usually against another faction attacking them.<br>
                This will reduce your relations with the other factions so other methods are easier.<br>
                An easier way is to read certain books, three of which increase noldor relations by<br>
                ten each. One is in the Laria town chest, which needs you to be the owner of the town<br>
                The other two are sold by the merchant in the Laria tavern.

                When your relations with the noldor reach zero from minus thirty the merchant in the Laria tavern will be willing to trade.
                He has two options, the first is to unlock his noldor equipment shop, which is some of the best gear in the game. 
                The second is to recruit some noldor fighters into your party, this costs a qualis gem and some noldor pottery.</p>

                When you reach thirty relations with the noldor the merchant in Laria will offer you a quest to kill a jatu horseman army.
                They're located in the woods and have between 150 to 300 troops of various ranks, they have been trying to find the noldor castle.
                After defeating them and returning to the noldor merchant in Laria you will be given the location of the noldor stronghold, Elacrai. </p>

            <p class = "noldortext">
                In Elacrai you have access to another noldor merchant and troop recruiter, as well as the ability to train with noldor to increase your weapon proficiencies.
            Theres also an npc who will give you a bit of lore about the game and why the noldor faction behave in the way that they do.
            The main reason benefit is to take part in the monthly noldor tournaments. They're against very high level enemies but the rewards are often expensive noldor equipment
            their high level horses and occasionally a qualis gem, you can place bets on yourself as with any other tournament. They are held from the 1st to the 5th of every
            in game month.</p>
